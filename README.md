# Why a kitchen???
My wife and I sometimes have trouble figuring out what we want to cook for dinner, so I made a website that lets us know what recipes we can make with our available ingredients! :sweat_smile::grin::stuck_out_tongue:

## How to search :monocle_face:
Simply select the ingredients you have from the menu on the left, then click the 'Find Recipes' button at the bottom of the page and Voila! :man_cook::woman_cook::bowl_with_spoon::fondue::green_salad::sandwich::fried_shrimp::spaghetti::lobster::pie::coffee:

<sub>There's lots of little things that can be interacted with around the kitchen if you want to look around</sub>

## Nerd stuff :nerd_face::nerd_face::nerd_face: 	
The site is built using NextJS and is hosted on Vercel. 
A MongoDB database and GraphQL are used to store and retrieve recipe/ingredient data.
Client data is only stored on the local machine. No logins!
